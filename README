#emailGrid

##An email newsletter grid template

Tables, tables, tables! Tables is stable, and we need to kick it oldschool for email newsletters. Fortunately I lived through the browser wars of the mid 90s. These are the best practices!

emailGrid is designed to get you off on the right foot for a bullet proof email template. This template is compatible with [Campaign Monitor](http://www.campaignmonitor.com). [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com) compatibility coming soon.

##Features

* 600px width. Any larger is just not recommended.
* 1, 2, 3, and 6 column widths, in addition to "floated image" columns (you can't float in emails, son).
* Share on Facebook, Twitter and Email using old-fashioned URLs.
* Find/replace namespaced variables if you are coding this bitch by hand.

##Replace Variables

* [eG-newsletterTitle] - The name of your newsletter
* [eG-issueTitle] - The subject of the email
* [eG-previewText] - Text to display in the preview pane of mobile devices and email clients
* [eG-issueUrl] - The URL of the email on your web server with protocol and trailing slash. Ex. http://yourdomain.com/newsletter/01-01/
* [eG-issueImg] - Image to use for sharing on Facebook
